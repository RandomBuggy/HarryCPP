/*
 * poly means many morphism means form
 * so ploymorphism means one name multiple forms
 * eg - function overloading, operator overloading
 * eg - virtual functions
 *
 * polymorphism primarily two types. 
 *      1. compile time polymorphism 
 *      2. run time polymorphism
 *
 *  1. compile time polymorphism:- function are binded during compilation that compiler already knows that function need to run for a object. also known as early binding/static binding
 *
 *  2. run time ploymorphism:- function binded during run time that in run time programme decide which function to bind and run. this type implemented using virtual functions
