/* 
 * object oriented programming is not yet another programming language but a way/approach/concept of programming which can be implemented by using OOP supported programming language like c++
 * in c++ to implement OOP, we use objects and class. basically classes are a data type 
 *
 * OOP model, works on the concept of class anfd objects
 * class are templates to create objects
 * treats data as a cretical element
 * as class is a template so no memory(RAM) is used during class creation but when a object is created through a class that object uses memory for variables and functions that are defined in the class and object hold its e.g data in a isolated memory block
 *
 * ##### OOP terminology #######
 *
 *
 * class --> a template for creating a object
 * object --> basic run time entities
 *
 * data abstraction and encapsulation --> wrapping data and function into a single unit
 *
 * inheritance --> calling another class's property to current isolated class
 *
 * polymorphism --> ability to take more than one forms ( e.g function overloading )
 *
 * dynamic binding --> code will not execute until the programme runs
 *
 * message passing --> object.message(info) call format 
 *
