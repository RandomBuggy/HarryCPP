/*
 * inheritance is a way to reuse code which is one of the main purpose of OOPS model
 *
 * the class which is inherited, is called derived class and from which class derived-class is made, is called base class
 *
 * there are several types of inheritance
 *      1. single inheritance
 *      2. multiple inheritance
 *      3. hierarchical inheritance
 *      4. multilevel inheritance
 *      5. hybrid inheritance
 *
 * single inheritance:- one base class to one derived class
 *
 * multiple inheritance:- multiple base class to one derived class
 *
 * hierarchical inheritance:- one base class to multiple derived class
 *
 * multilevel inheritance:- deriving a class from already derived class
 *
 * hybrid inheritance:- hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.
