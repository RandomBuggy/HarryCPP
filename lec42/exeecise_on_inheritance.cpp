 *
 *
 * now, answer these question:-
 *  Q1. what type of inheritance you are using?
 *  Q2. which mode of inheritance you are using?
 *  Q3. create an object of HybridCalculator class and display the result of both simle calculator and scientific calculator class?
 *  Q4. how is code reusability imolemented?
