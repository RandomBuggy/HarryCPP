#include <iostream>

/*
 * header files: are a regular file which contains functions prototype or functions definition. header file are basically types:-
 *      1. system header files: comes with compiler
 *      2. user-defined header files: written by programmer
 *
 *
 *      for system header file use < >
 *      for user-def header file use " "
 *
 *
 * operators: there are many types of operator in c++. like
 *      1.Arithmatic operator:
 *        a. plus: +
 *        b. minus: -
 *        c. multiply: *
 *        d. division: /
 *        e. modulo: %
 *        *** there are two special operator. they are increment ++ and decrement -- operator. they have two state prefix, postfix. In prefix state first print variable's value then add 1 but In postfix state first add 1 then print value ***
 *      2.Assignment operator:
 *        a. =
 *        b. +=
 *        c. -=
 *        d. *=
 *        d. /=
 *      3.Comparision operators:
 *        a. ==
 *        b. !=
 *        c. >
 *        d. <
 *        e. >=
 *        f. <=
 *      4.logical operators:
 *        a. &&
 *        b. ||
 *        c. !
 *      5.bitwise operstors:
 *        a.
